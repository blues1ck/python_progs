In mathematics, graph theory is the study of graphs
mathematical structures used to model 
pairwise relations between objects.
Graphs can be used to model many types of relations and processes in physical, biological, social and information systems.
Within computer science, cybernetics uses graphs to represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc.
